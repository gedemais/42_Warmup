------------- Exercice 02 -------------

Show me your pass

The goal of this exercise is to learn about files permissions in UNIX filesystems.

Vocabulary needed:
- Permissions
- Owner
- User
- Group

You will have to turn in several files with different permissions into a folder
named 'permissions/' :
- The first file must be named 'hello_world' and allows for user to read and write it.
- The second file must be named 'ushallnotpass' and allow nothing for nobody.
- The third file must be named 'openbar' and allows for user, group, and others to read, write, and execute it.
- The fourth file must be named 'classic' and allows for user to read, write, and execute it.
  It also allows group to read and write it, and allows others to read it only.

You will also have to redirect the output of this command :

ls -l permissions/

Into a file named 'result', located in the permissions/ directory.

Remember, stay calm, and RTFM.
