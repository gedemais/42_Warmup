# 42_Warmup (English, French in README.fr.md)
A simple course to follow before trying the piscine in 42 school.

# Forewords

Maybe at some point in your life you told yourself something like:
"I can't be good in computer science, math, or physics... it's too complicated, it requires some skills or degrees I do not have."
If this is not the case for you, please go straight through the tutorial and don't waste your time reading theses forewords.
For the others, well, let me tell you why you are wrong.

Computer science has always been closely linked with mathematics and physics, and all of three are essentially sitting in the same axiums of any human mind.
Anyone who already have driven a few cars in his life will basically be able to drive any car after that.

What I am trying to explain here is that, by starting working on some problem in a totally "out-of-your-expertise" environment for you (maybe like programming),
you will be completely lost at first, but as this environment is stable and purely logical (just like programming), some logical patterns are gonna repeat.
And you will have an opportunity to learn something more about that new environment for each of thoses repetitions.
Staying calm and open-minded about your problems may just be the best solution to solve them on the short and long-term.

Being a good programmer takes a lot of things, and maybe you have none of them.
That doesn't really matter, as thoses things are only more steps to the stairs.
Great news is that the only thing you need to get thoses things is work.
The harder you will work, the faster you will climb the stairs.
I've personnaly climbed a few steps arleady, and I remember doing it and realising I did it as the best moments in my life.

Just never drop it, and you will see your investment coming back to the hundred. I am (as are my 42 fellows) an alive proof of this.

# Did you say "la piscine" ?

Welcome to this course. First things first, let's talk a bit about 42 and the piscine.
42 is an association founded by Xavier Niel, Nicolas Sadirac, Kwame Yamgnane, and Florian Bucher in 2013.
The goal of this association is to train computer-science fascinated newbies, and make competent, resourcefuls, and smart badasses out of them.
To be able to follow the (more or less) 3 years long cursus of 42, you will have to survive to the piscine first, and then to be selected out of it.

The piscine system has evolved a bit through the years, but there are precisions on the current (2021) system that didn't change since the start of 42 :

- A piscine generally has about 800 persons on the starting day, and about 250 - 300 of them will drop it before the final exam.
  About 200 - 300 new students are selected after the piscine. The answer is a mail, and is very stressful to open.
  The goal of this month is to introduce you to the world of computer science and programmation, and test your willing / interest for it.
  You will have to complete rated exercises and get them corrected by your pairs.
  You will be judged by all the rates you get, and a whole lot of others stats about your comportment.
  The selection algorithm is kept secret and known by a very few persons.

- The correction pool is a system made to increase the peer-learning intuition of students in 42.
  During the piscine, you will have to get your projects validated by getting them corrected by other "piscineux".
  Theses corrections will cost you "correction points", one per correction.
  Obviously, the only way to make correction points is to... correct someone, right.
  You can inform other people that you want to correct people by setting a slot.
  Then, people who want to validate a project can see your slot spawning in defenses schedule, and book it so you can correct them.
  After all of your corrections (multiple corrections are needed to validate each projects), you will automatically be corrected by the "Moulinette".
  The Moulinette is a testing program used to check that your work is okay.
  Spoiler alert : Most of the time in 42 spirit, 19.999999999999 / 20 is equivalent to 0 / 20, meaning that any error will generally cause your project to get rated at 0.
  Meaning you will have to fix any problem in your project, then correct 3 - 5 persons to get corrected 3 - 5 times by piscineux, then pray again the Moulinette.
  
- A piscine has differents exercises to train / test you :
  - "Days", which are exercises assignments sheets, that you have to complete as fast as you can during the piscine. Theses projects must be corrected by piscineux, and are the       biggest load of work during the piscine.

  - Rushs, small-sized projects that you will have to complete in a team of 3 students, your 2 mates being randomly choosen in the piscine. Theses projects are corrected by the       staff, and do not require any correction points. They have to be completed during each week-end, except the last one.

  - Exams, which are 4 hours sessions you will have to complete without any internet connection or discussion with your mates, to validate your skills at the end of each week. Theses project are automatically corrected by the moulinette.

- A piscine is four weeks (26 days) long, and is scheduled as so :

----- Week 1 -----
