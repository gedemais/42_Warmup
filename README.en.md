# 42_Warmup (English, French in README.fr.md)
A simple course to follow before trying the piscine in 42 school.

# Forewords

Maybe at some point in your life you told yourself something like:
"I can't be good in computer science, math, or physics... it's too complicated, it requires some skills or degrees I do not have."
If this is not the case for you, please go straight through the tutorial and don't waste your time reading theses forewords.
For the others, well, let me tell you why you are wrong.

Computer science has always been closely linked with mathematics and physics, and all of three are essentially sitting in the same axiums of any human mind.
Anyone who already have driven a few cars in his life will basically be able to drive any car after that.

What I am trying to explain here is that, by starting working on many problems in a totally "out-of-your-expertise" environment for you (maybe like programming),
you will be completely lost at first, but as this environment is stable and purely logical (just like programming, or driving), some logical patterns are gonna repeat.
And you will have an opportunity to learn something more about that new environment for each of thoses repetitions.
Staying calm and open-minded about your problems will always be a better solution to solve them.
Anyone is smart enough for programming doing physics and maths, some peolpe just enjoy it more than others.

Being a good programmer though takes a lot of things, and maybe you have none of them.
That doesn't really matter, as thoses things are only additional steps to the stairs.
Great news is that the only thing you need to get thoses things is work.
The harder you will work, the faster you will climb the stairs.
I've personnaly climbed a few steps arleady, and I remember doing it and realising I did it as the best moments in my life.

Just never drop it, and you will see your investment coming back to the hundred. I am (as are my 42 fellows) an alive proof of this.

# Did you say "la piscine" ?

Welcome to this course. First things first, let's talk a bit about 42 and the piscine.
42 is a free association founded by Xavier Niel, Nicolas Sadirac, Kwame Yamgnane, and Florian Bucher in 2013.
The goal of this association is to train computer-science fascinated newbies / nerds, and make competent, resourcefuls, smart, and badass devs out of them.
To be able to follow the 3 years long cursus of 42 (+/-) , you will have to survive to the piscine first, and then to be selected out of it.

The piscine system has evolved a bit through the years, but there are precisions on the current (2021) system that didn't change since the start of 42 :

- A piscine generally counts around 800 persons on the starting day, and about 250 - 300 of them will drop it before the final exam.
  About 200 - 300 new students are selected after the piscine. The answer is a mail, and is very stressful to open.
  The goal of this month is to introduce you to the world of computer science and programming, and test your willing / interest for it.
  You will have to complete rated exercises and get them corrected by your peers.
  Your ONLY resources are a .pdf subject file, people around you in the cluster, and Google.
  You will be judged by all the rates you get, and a whole lot of others stats about your comportment.
  The selection algorithm is kept secret and known by a very few persons.

- The correction pool is a system made to increase the peer-learning intuition of students in 42.
  During the piscine, you will have to get your projects validated by getting them corrected by other "piscineux" (swimming-poolers).
  Theses corrections will cost you correction points, one per correction. You can see the number of correction points you have on your intranet page.
  Obviously, the only way to make correction points is to... correct someone, right.
  You can inform other people that you want to correct someone by setting a slot.
  Then, people who want to validate a project can see your slot spawning in defenses schedule, and book it so you can correct them.
  After all of your corrections (multiple corrections are needed to validate each projects), you will automatically be corrected by the "Moulinette".
  The Moulinette is a testing program used to check that your work is okay.
  Spoiler alert : Most of the time in 42 spirit, 19.999999999999 / 20 is equivalent to 0 / 20, meaning that most of errors will cause your project to get rated at 0.
  Meaning you will have to fix any problem in your project, then correct 3 - 5 persons to get corrected 3 - 5 times by piscineux, then pray again the Moulinette.
  
- A piscine has differents exercises to train / test you :
  - "Days", which are exercises assignments sheets, that you have to complete as fast as you can during the piscine.
    Theses projects must be corrected by piscineux, and are the biggest load of work during the piscine.

  - Rushes, small-sized projects that you will have to complete in a team of 3 students, your 2 mates being randomly choosen in the piscine.
	Theses projects are corrected by the staff, and do not require any correction points. They have to be completed during each week-end, except the last one ofc.

  - Exams, which are 2-4 hours sessions of days-like exercises, that you will have to complete without any internet connection or discussion with your mates,
	to validate your skills at the end of each week. Theses project are automatically corrected by the moulinette in real time, exercise per exercise.

The goal of the piscine is to validate as much projects as you can, including days,
rushes, and exams, by applying peer-learning techniques.

- A piscine is four weeks (26 days) long. Every week is scheduled as so :

Monday : Start working on days (again).
Friday : Exam.
Week-End (Right after the exam until sunday, 11h42 P.M) : Rush project.

No, you won't be able to take your week-ends off. To give you more infos about
the quantity of work expected, average piscineux that hope to get choosen at the
end of the piscine will work around 12-16h a day.
They will not be in the school 12-16h a day (a little more in fact), they will be coding, focused on their screen 12-16h / day.
I highly recommand you to install f.lux on your 42 session. Your eyes will thank me later.

The COVID has changed many things though:
- You will usually start your piscine with lower effectives than specified upper.
  Around 250-300 starters are allowed for each piscine (June 2021).

- You won't be able to sleep in 42. It is normally the case during piscine, as
  people are coming from all France and all around the world to participate, so
  you better free your mind about where to sleep / how to eat before to come.

- You will be allowed to login into only one of the three clusters most of the time.

I am really sorry I have to put this here, but the truth is there :
If you are a newbie in computer science, don't let people around help you too much,
especially as a girl. Even if 42-Paris currently has the best mixity rate in computer-science
schools around the world, boys are still boys. And they will probably want to help you juuust a little
more than their other mates, allowing you to make it through the piscine while doing nothing, or much less.
You would just get smashed in exams as you have learned nothing. Even if you actually get
selected after the piscine (probably taking the place of a more deserving person than you :(),
you will get fired pretty soon as you won't be able to complete projects in time.
Except if you cheat (again). If you are fucked-up enough to do that, please just
go and cheat during your whole life. We'll see.

About Days :
 Days usually count 5 to 20 exercises. The 2 first days won't be C exercises
 as you may have learned. Theses ones comes after. First thing you will have to
 learn is how to use a shell command line a bit. After this, every C day will have
 specific theme you will learn about.

About Exams :
 Exams can be some really stressfull events for a lot of people.
 My advices about it are :
 - Staying calm during exams is really important. If you feel that you are too
   stressed out to code without making mistakes, just take 5 - 10mn to close your
   eyes, breath deeply, relax and get your focus back.

 - Never panic and give up when you fail an exercise, and more generally,
   never think you are done as long as you didn't the very last little point you can get.

 - Do not give up if you fail the first exam. It's normal. If you do fail,
   you will have to work harder. Yeah, just call me a bitch. Great.

 - (This one is also valuable for days, rushes, and any C code you will have to give in).
   Use any tool at your disposition if you are not ABSOLUTELY sure about something.
   A few ones coming in my mind :
	- Manuals. In a general way, RTFM attentively before to ask any question.
	  Without internet connection, that's the only data you can rely on.

	- Compiler flags. Use -g3 -fsanitize=address when compiling your C code.
	  You'll thank me later if you're """"""tough"""""" enough understand how to use it.

	- gdb, which may not be installed depending on the examshell versions.
	  Idem.

I personnaly hated every exams I had to do, until I managed to validate one.
Exams gets really exciting at this point.

About Rushes :
- 

Generalities :

- NEVER think that working 17 to 19h with 5 hours of sleep will be more (or even equally)
  productive than working 14 to 16h and sleep 8h hours. That's really not a tactical choice.
  Sleep is the most important thing in piscine. Trust me, you will be able to
  observe this during the 3rd and 4th weeks. The Walking Dead bro.

- You will also observe really soon that constantly thinking about how to
  understand / solve a new problem is very energy consuming. You won't be as
  productive and code-aware AT ALL at 6 P.M, or when you just eated, than in the morning.
  Try to think about that when you're about to decide what to do for the next 2 hours.

- Eating well is more than important there. Maybe you're sitting all day
  long on your chair, but your brain is consuming a lot of stuff, especially in
  a new environment like the piscine. Digestion fatigue is also an important thing to think about.

The piscine is a life-marking experience for anyone trying to do it seriously.
It really changes the way you consider working and collaboration with people, and
also teaches you (if you don't know it already) how much your personal implication
in a project will define how well (and how fast) you will achieve it. I was 17
when I tryed the piscine, and that was really, like REALLY mind-blowing. I didn't
stop coding after the piscine, until I got accepted in 42, then I didn't stop
coding after that for the last 3 years. And I am really grateful to 42 for this.

Interesting questions :

- Should I practice before trying the piscine ?
- This is really up to you.
  If you just want to try the piscine, and maybe discover yourself as a great
  potential dev, but you don't really know if you're made for it, I would rather
  suggest you to go at the piscine with your hands in your pockets. This formation
  was made for people who never coded before, you don't need any computer-science,
  math or physics knowledge AT ALL, just to know how to move the mouse and type on the keyboard.
  Don't worry about failing, because this month will never be lost, and because
  you can retry another piscine later.

  If you really know what you want, and if you want to follow the 42 cursus,
  I will suggest you to keep reading this page. This repo was made for that.


Stupid questions :

- A free school of that kind sounds pretty weird...
Are you gonna have to work for Free after the school ?
Or will 42 take something on your pay ?
- Hell no XD. The goal of 42 is not to create a little army of devs for Free, but to
compensate the lack of investments France have been making in numerical education
for the last 10 years. Xavier Niel litterally offered 100 millions euros for Paris campus.
And it worked A.F all around the world, except in US.
Still dunno why "free school" strictly means "shitty school" to you guys...
Anyway, there are no hidden vices in this formation.
